Objective:
Add a Thumbtack 5-star review badge to the banner section of my website. The badge should be clickable and redirect users to my Thumbtack review page. The design should blend seamlessly with the banner and maintain responsiveness across desktop and mobile devices.

Instructions:
HTML Code Placement:
Add the following HTML code inside the banner section of my website:

html
Copy code
<div class="banner">
  <!-- Existing banner content -->
  
  <!-- Thumbtack 5-star review badge -->
  <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/ny/new-york/tax-preparation/imran-baig-cpa/service/389548675861151756" 
     target="_blank" 
     rel="noopener noreferrer" 
     class="thumbtack-badge">
    <img src="/assets/images/thumbtack-badge.png" 
         alt="Thumbtack 5-Star Reviews" 
         style="width: 100px; height: auto;">
  </a>
</div>
URL: Ensure the badge links to this Thumbtack review page:
https://www.thumbtack.com/ny/new-york/tax-preparation/imran-baig-cpa/service/389548675861151756.
Image File:

Use the provided image of the Thumbtack badge (you can resize it to 100px width if necessary).
Save the image in the project directory under /assets/images/thumbtack-badge.png.
Styling:
Add CSS to style the badge and ensure it blends with the banner. Here's an example:

css
Copy code
/* Thumbtack Badge Styling */
.thumbtack-badge img {
  width: 100px; /* Adjust badge size */
  height: auto;
  border-radius: 5px; /* Optional: rounded edges */
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Optional: subtle shadow */
}

.banner {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* Spread banner content */
  align-items: center; /* Align vertically */
}

.thumbtack-badge {
  margin-left: auto; /* Push badge to the right */
}
Testing:

Ensure the badge is visible and aligned correctly in the banner.
Check responsiveness to confirm it displays well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Verify the badge redirects users to the correct Thumbtack review page when clicked.
Deployment:
Once confirmed, deploy the changes to the live site.

Additional Notes:
If any adjustments are needed for the banner’s layout or design, ensure these changes are consistent with the website’s branding.
Let me know if you need the Thumbtack image file or further clarification.
