dd a build Script in package.json
Open your package.json file in the root directory of your app.

Ensure that there is a build script under the "scripts" section. For example:

json
Copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "react-scripts build" // Replace with the correct build command for your app
  }
}
Common build commands:

React: "build": "react-scripts build"
Angular: "build": "ng build --prod"
Vue: "build": "vue-cli-service build"
Svelte: "build": "rollup -c"
Commit and push the updated package.json file.

2. Specify the Build Command in the Workflow
If your app requires a custom build command, you can define it directly in your GitHub Actions workflow file:

yaml
Copy
- name: Build and Deploy Static Web App
  uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1
  with:
    azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
    app_location: "/"
    api_location: "api" # Or leave blank if you don't have an API
    output_location: "build" # Adjust based on your app's output directory
    app_build_command: "npm run build" # Specify your build command here
Replace npm run build with the correct build command for your app.

3. Install the Correct Node.js Version
The logs indicate that your app is using Node.js 18.20.4. Ensure this version is available and being used.

Update the workflow to install the correct Node.js version:

yaml
Copy
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: 18.x
4. Verify Your Application Structure
Azure expects the following:

app_location: The root directory containing your app (e.g., / or client/).
output_location: The directory where the build output is generated (e.g., build/ or dist/).
Double-check these paths in the workflow file and ensure they match your project structure.

5. Test the Build Locally
Before pushing the changes, test the build process locally:

Run the following commands:
bash
Copy
npm install
npm run build
Verify that a build or equivalent output directory is generated successfully.
6. Common Fixes
If you're using a monorepo, ensure that tools like lerna.json or lage.config.js are configured correctly and the workflow specifies the correct app directory.
If no framework is used, ensure thereâ€™s a static site generator or a pre-built static file directory, and adjust output_location accordingly.
7. Retry the Workflow
Push your changes and retry the workflow in GitHub Actions.
